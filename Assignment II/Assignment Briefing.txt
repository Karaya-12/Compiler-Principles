1. Write A Lex Source Program (.l File), e.g. example.l
2. Generate .C File Based On The Lex Source Program Using Flex
3. Compile The C Program Into .out File or .exe File
4. Test The Generated Simple Lexical Analyzer

- Implement 2 Main Functions
  - Translate Your Student ID Number In The Import File --> Your Name / Nickname
  - Count ID & Chars In The Import File


* Example
